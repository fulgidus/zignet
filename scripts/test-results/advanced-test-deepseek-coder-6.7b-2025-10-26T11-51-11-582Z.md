## Results

### 1. Basic Zig Syntax [EASY]

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Time**: 18.36s
**Response**:
```zig
Here is a simple example of a Zig function named "add" that adds two integer numbers:

```zig
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
    return a + b;
}
```
This `add` function takes in two parameters (both are integers), and returns the sum of these two integers. The "i32" refers to an integer type with a width of 32 bits, which is one of Zig's few built-in integer types. You can replace it with other data types as per your requirement.

```

### 2. Memory Allocation [EASY]

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Time**: 23.63s
**Response**:
```zig
In Zig, we can use `allocator.create` for allocation of memory and `allocator.destroy` for deallocation or memory freeing. Here is a simple example:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();

    const allocator = gpa.allocator();
    
    // Allocate memory for an integer and store a value
    var number = try allocator.create(i32);
    errdefer allocator.destroy(number); // clean up if allocatio
```

### 3. Error Handling [MEDIUM]

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Time**: 45.52s
**Response**:
```zig
In Zig programming language, we can return a `Result` from a function which is an enumeration of two possibilities: `Ok(T)` and `Err(E)` where T represents the successful result and E represents some error condition that happened during execution.

Here's a simple example:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

// Define an enum for errors
error FileNotFoundError = error{FileNotFound};

pub fn readFile(allocator: *std.mem.Allocator, path: []const u8) ![]u8 {
    // Open the file and return Err if 
```

### 4. Structs & Methods [MEDIUM]

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Time**: 21.51s
**Response**:
```zig
Here is how you can define it in Zig programming language:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;

pub const Point = struct {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,

    pub fn distanceFromOrigin(self: Point) f64 {
        return math.sqrt((self.x * self.x) + (self.y * self.y));
    }
};
```

This code defines a struct `Point` with two fields `x` and `y` of type `f64` to store the coordinates. It also includes a method named `distanceFromOrigin()` which calculates and returns the distance f
```

### 5. Generics [HARD]

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Time**: 30.03s
**Response**:
```zig
Below is an example of how you can create such a function in Zig programming language. This function is named `max` and it accepts 2 parameters, both are instances of `anytype` which represents any possible value. The body of the function checks if first parameter is greater than second one then returns first otherwise return second.

```zig
fn max(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {
    return if (a > b) a else b;
}
```
Note that to use this function you must specify the numeric type `T` at compi
```

### 6. Comptime Magic [HARD]

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Time**: 28.12s
**Response**:
```zig
In Zig, `comptime` is used for computations that need to be done during compilation, as opposed to runtime where they are executed post-compilation. Below is an example of how you can use it to compute a factorial at compile time.

```zig
fn Factorial(comptime n: usize) usize {
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) return 1;
    return n * comptime Factorial(n - 1);
}
```

The above function `Factorial` is a recursive one which multiplies the current number with the factorial of the previous number until it
```
